# Background

# Usage

Don't use it. The same concept is achieved much better using React, Vue, or the like.

If you want to use it, you just need a static file server, such as the one that comes with Python.

```
python -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 80
```

If you want to make use of the PHP fallback, then run it via some PHP-enabled server.
This was probably written using PHP 5.6 and there's no guarantee it'll work on newer versions.
