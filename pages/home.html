<p>I am  detail-oriented and technical-minded, and constantly seek out helpful, beneficial, and efficient coding techniques. Because of my knowledge, capabilities,  and eagerness to expand my skillset, my friends call me a programming reference guide! In fact, this custom website is an example of my work!</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://example.com">blog</a> where I write about Website design, development, and general technology. A supporter of open source software, I believe some of the best software available is open source. That is why I actively use and contribute to open source projects as well as open source most of my work.</p>

<p>As far as my educational history, I am an honor graduate of <a target="_blank" href="#">Generic Technical College</a>, earning an Associates of Applied Science in Website Development. I am currently enrolled at <a target="_blank" href="">Generic Higher Education College</a> completing classes for a Bachelor's degree.</p>
